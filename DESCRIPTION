Description: This package uses the marginal
  relationship between predictor variables and a response to identify a small 
  subset of measurements which appear
  relevant for prediction, produce a low-dimensional linear embedding based on this
  small subset, and amplify this embedding with information from
  the remaining measurements. The goal is to perform principle components regression
  (PCR), but in high dimensional settings where the number of measurements
  exceeds the number of observations. The technique employed uses some approximation
  methods to increase statistical and computational efficiency.
